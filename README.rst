Cookicutter GEMSEO
------------------

A Cookiecutter_ template for creating a python package that uses GEMSEO_.

How to use
----------

See Cookiecutter_ for installing and using the ``cookiecutter`` executable,
we recommend using `pipx <https://pypa.github.io/pipx/>`_ for installing it.

Run

.. code::

    cookiecutter https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/cookiecutter-gemseo

and answer the questions regarding the following information:

- ``author_name``: the name of the author.
- ``author_email``: the email of the author.
- ``project_name_suffix``: the project repository will be named ``gemseo-`` with the suffix.
- ``project_slug``: the name of the python package.
- ``project_short_description``: a short description of the project that goes in the ``README.rst``.
- ``gemseo_min_version``: the minimum version of GEMSEO_ required by the package, use ``develop`` to use the develop branch of GEMSEO_.
- ``package_is_a_gemseo_plugin``: whether the package is a plugin for GEMSEO_ (add package entry points).

The files generated by the Cookiecutter_ shall be placed in a git repository.

A package created with this cookiecutter uses the same kind of development environment and tools as GEMSEO_.
See its
`developer <https://gemseo.readthedocs.io/en/develop/software/contributing_dev.html>`_
and
`maintainer <https://gemseo.readthedocs.io/en/develop/software/maintenance.html>`_
docs for more information.

In particular,
once the dependencies of your code have been defined in ``setup.cfg``,
you shall run

.. code::

    tox -e update-deps-test-py37,update-deps-test-py38,update-deps-test-py39,update-deps-test-py310

to set the dependencies for the testing environments.
